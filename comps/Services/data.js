      "Solea® is a breakthrough technology that enables virtually every cavity prep to be performed anesthesia-free, delivering a dental experience patients prefer. Solea also enables soft tissue procedures that are blood-free and suture-free with minimal post-op discomfort and remarkably rapid healing.",
    productSubHead: "",
    productSubCopy: "",
    iconCopyOne: `By eliminating the primary causes of patient anxiety (the needle and the drill), Solea
    delivers a dental experience patients prefer. When needles, numbness, and the sound of
    the drill, and the pain are all removed from a patient’s dental experience, two important
    things happen: 1) Patients never settle for a traditional experience again, and 2) They
    encourage their family and friends to experience the same.`,
    iconCopyTwo: `Enjoy the highest degree of control over procedures and practice truly minimally invasive
    dentistry. For hard tissue, Solea allows for selective tissue ablation, which results in the
    preservation of healthy tooth structure and minimized risk of iatrogenic damage. Solea
    also provides a bactericidal effect because laser energy kills all bacteria with which it
    comes in contact. For soft and osseous tissue, Solea enables precise control and is both
    atraumatic and virtually blood-free, allowing you to deliver better outcomes than you
    could deliver using traditional instruments.`,
    iconCopyThree: `By eliminating anesthesia, Solea removes obstacles that slow you down and limit what
    you can accomplish in a single visit. No more calming patients down, injecting the
    anesthesia, waiting for it to take effect, and scheduling multiple visits for multi-quadrant
    dentistry. With Solea, you simply greet the patient, get started, and stay until treatment is
    complete. Enjoy more control over your schedule and feel like you are working less.`,
    iconCopyFour: `Solea dentists perform soft and osseous tissue procedures because they are simple,
    fast, and minimally invasive. By virtually eliminating bleeding, sutures, and post-
    operative pain, you can add higher revenue procedures – such as gingivectomies,
    frenectomies, and flapless crown lengthening – previously referred out or ignored. Your
    patients will love receiving treatment from a dentist they know and trust, and they will be
    amazed by the remarkably rapid healing process and absence of post-operative pain.`,
